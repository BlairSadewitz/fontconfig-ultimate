* The entire fontconfig-infinality-ultimate structure has been reworked
  to better fit within fontconfig configuration principles. The 'nesting'
  style configuration model known from generic fontconfig-infinality
  has been entirely abandoned marking mutual independence of both
  packages.

* Default Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace faces are now set hierarchically in
  /etc/fonts/conf.d/60-latin.conf. In order to override these settings, the
  user is supposed to create a custom file in the local, XDG compliant 
  fontconfig directory (a relevant example has been provided). Once
  custom settings have been created, they will be honored by applications.

* Consequently, any further user customizations should be introduced in
  the local fontconfig files.

* Templates for user customizations have been updated.

* A couple of default font substitutions (this should solve recurring
  problems with Helveticas):

    - Helvetica => Arial
    - Helvetica Neue => Open Sans

* Rendering parameters for numerous fonts have been tweaked / fixed /
  modified.
